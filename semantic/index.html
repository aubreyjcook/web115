            <p>Since I was in my early twenties I have studied Japanese. It has been my goal to become completely fluent in the language and possibly visit Japan one day. My main incentive for learning the language however was the potential of finding work in a technical industry where intermediaries of native-speaking English people who can speak Japanese fluently would be needed. The Japanese people (Who refer to themselves as 'Nipponese' traditionally) have extensive ties to the technical industries, and Japan is one of the most prosperous developed countries worldwide today, being one of the largest hubs of technological development on a global scale.</p>

            <h2>♦ Reading and Writing Japanese ♦</h2>
            <p>The Japanese writing system is one of the most complicated in the world, and in terms of linguistic rules it is about as far removed from English as any language that exists. This makes learning to read and write Japanese very difficult for native English readers, but with practice and dilligence it is possible.</p>
            <p>The most important thing to understand about the Japanese writing system is that there are three seperate systems of written characters, however, two of them (Hiragana and Katakana (ひらがな, カタカナ) fall within the same definition of being a syllabary, or "Kana (仮名)" as they are referred to in Japanese. The third (Kanji (漢字)) is the most traditional form of writing that you will see used, which is not a syllabary. The way I like to think of these two systems is the same way in which English words are written: Letters of the alphabet represent specific sounds we make with our mouths on their own, but when combined together they form <em>words</em> which are what actually have meaning. While this is not a complete allegory for how the Japanese writing system actually works (there is more nuance than this) it is sufficient to think of the Kana as specific sounds written as characters, and Kanji as full-fledged words that form sentences. Finally, there is a fourth system of writing Japanese that is not considered traditional by any means, which is called Romaji. Romaji is Japanese syllables written in Latin script, that is the English alphabet, for example, there is a given character within the Kana for the sound 'ka' (か) or 'tsu' (つ) or 'ho' (ほ) and the way for the these to be written in Romaji is just as I have written them here ('ka','tsu','ho') since these are how these syllables are pronounced as they would appear in the English alphabet. Romaji is not typical of Japanese writing, you won't find any roadsigns or books written in Japanese using it, but it is useful in teaching those who understand the Latin alphabet a bit about how Japanese characters are supposed to sound.</p>

                <figcaption>This typical subway sign in Japan illustrates each of the writing systems in the Japanese language aptly. The largest characters in the center and top right are <em>Kanji,</em> the characters under the left center mark are <em>Katakana</em> and on the right is <em>Romaji.</em> Finally the markings next to the arrow in the bottom left are <em>Hiragana</em> with more Romaji underneath which translates exactly to the syllables stated in the Hiragana.</figcaption>

            <h2>♦ Speaking and Listening to Japanese ♦</h2>
            <p>In contrast to the difficulty of learning the written language of Japanese, learning to speak it is surprisingly much easier. It is entirely possible to learn to only speak Japanese without learning any of the writing system. While learning to speak Japanese can be much less complicated than learning the nuanced writing system, it still can take time. One thing to be aware of is that Japanese is spoken in a different typological order than English, that is, in English sentences are spoken in order of "subject, verb, noun" but, in Japanese a sentence is stated "subject, noun, verb." Anyone who has watched Star Wars will be familiar with the iconic way of speaking that the character Yoda uses, and this is something along the lines of how Japanese sentences are structured, or at least how they would be in English. It isn't so hard for us to realize how the Japanese speak given this context, their language is just like any other, but with different sounds.</p>
